# Heart-attack-risk-predictor-

I've used various Algorithms to predict the result and see which one suits best and then used Auto ML Library EVAL ML to predict the results.

I've done the following in this project:
-Data Analysis
-Feature Engineering
-Satandardization
-Model Building
-Predictions

Understanding the dataset:
Age : Age of the patient

Sex : Sex of the patient

exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

ca: number of major vessels (0-3)

cp : Chest Pain type chest pain type

Value 0: typical angina

Value 1: atypical angina

Value 2: non-anginal pain

Value 3: asymptomatic

trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

chol : cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor

fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

rest_ecg : resting electrocardiographic results

Value 0: normal

Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)

Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

thalach : maximum heart rate achieved

target : 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack

Following models have been used for predictions :
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
K Nearest Neighbour
SVM
